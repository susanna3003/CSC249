# 🏎️ Data Structures Class Repository - Lights Out and Away We Go!

Welcome to the pit lane of my Data Structures class repository! This README serves as an introduction to the garage where all the coding action happens. Strap in as we navigate hairpin turns, tackle chicanes, and accelerate through the straights of algorithms and structures.

## 👨‍💻 Status Update: A Rookie in the Paddock
As of now, I’m a promising midfield contender in the coding championship, steadily climbing the constructor’s standings. My current form includes:

- 🏁 Successfully navigating arrays and linked lists (some corner-cutting may have occurred).
- 🛠️ Pit stop-level optimizations on stacks and queues.
- 🔍 Laying the groundwork for tree traversal strategies.

This season’s goal: Secure a podium finish by mastering graphs and hash tables!

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
To access my code:
1. Clone the repository into your own garage:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/susanna3003/CSC249
   ```
2. Check your systems for required dependencies (fuel and tire changes might apply).
3. Hit the accelerator and start coding!

## 🤩 Why I’m Excited for This Race (Class)
- **Data Structures:** The engine of computer science—let’s rev it up!
- **F1 References:** My professor, Mr. Norris, is an absolute legend, weaving motorsport memes into assignments. Each task feels like a pit stop with strategic decisions to make.
- **Nerdy Brainrot:** Let’s just say, my excitement is stuck in DRS mode (read: unstoppable).

## 🏎️ Favorite Circuit Features (Highlights of Assignments)
1. **Singly Linked Lists:** Like a clean overtake—precise and satisfying.
2. **Stacks:** Vertical excitement, much like a pit crew stacking tires.
3. **Graphs:** A dynamic race track layout that keeps you guessing.

## 🚥 Final Thoughts
With Mr. Norris as race director, this class promises to be full of unexpected twists, safety cars, and maybe even a fastest lap or two. I’m ready to push to the limit, extract maximum downforce from my code, and hit the apex of learning.

Here’s to a great season—see you on the podium!

#### TL;DR
If this README doesn’t scream "suspected illegal flexi-wing," then I don’t know what does. Let’s goooooo! 🎉
